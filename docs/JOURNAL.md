# Journal

What happened, and what the tree looked like when it happened. Appended
automatically by `tools/journal.sh` from the post-commit hook — newest first.

Git stores the diff; this stores the context around it: outstanding hazard
counts, whether the docs still agreed with the code, which files moved. That is
the part that makes a change legible later, and the part nobody writes down.
